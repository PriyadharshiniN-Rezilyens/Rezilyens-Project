# Rezilyens-Project

ðŸ“Š Cyber Risk Assessment Using Graph-Based Clustering
This project performs risk assessment of organizational assets using graph-based techniques on cybersecurity data provided in Project 1 of the Rezilyens internship assignment.

Instead of the Bayesian approach, we apply graph modeling, Louvain community detection, and centrality-based scoring to evaluate and rank assets based on their risk exposure.
